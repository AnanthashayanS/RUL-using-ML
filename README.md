# RUL-using-ML
Remaining useful life (RUL) detection is the process of estimating how much longer a motor will last before it fails. This information can be used to schedule preventive maintenance, avoid unexpected downtime, and improve the overall reliability of the motor.
Machine learning (ML) can be used to predict RUL by analyzing data from the motor's sensors. This data can include things like temperature, vibration, current, and voltage. ML algorithms can be trained on this data to learn how to identify patterns that indicate that the motor is nearing the end of its life.
